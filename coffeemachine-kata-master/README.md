# Coffeemachine Kata

This my implementation of  a simple legacy coffeemachine commandline application.
It uses only statics and is strongly coupled to the System global.
You can use it to practice adding characterization tests and refactoring.

The code was found on [stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/83135/designing-a-coffee-machine)
